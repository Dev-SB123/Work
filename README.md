# Work

*All written in LUA as well as ROBLOX video game engine

Hello, my name is Sebastian, I am posting some of my scripts that I have made for a roblox game that I have worked on for a while by my own. I am proud of it though
it might not look pretty at times. I still need to clean and polish aspects of my code, I will comeback from time to time to fix it. Some of the code did start off as a sample
that ROBLOX offered, but I didn't just copy and paste I took my time to understand it and make it more complex but overall every line I have written should be original. 
I will be posting some modules that I made, as well as server scripts for saving data for players, inventory scripts, glory kill scripts, inventory loadouts that the player can see,
maybe a couple of scripts for weapons, as well and a sprint scripts. Before I go, this was all a years worth of work, I started out as a novice though I knew python I didn't apply
it or my computer programming skills until I started ROBLOX, I have seen myself improve vastly I still look at forums for help but it is less often.

Anyone can look through copy or be inspired by my code I will also accept advice on how I could improve my code.

Current project that I might tackle on is making a gun, (I need to use physics, take the trajectory path and get the derivative of this trajectory with respect to time, 2d 
vectors can then be made using the derivative at points I will have to make it tangent to the trajectory which is simple, let c be a constant that x approaches f'(c)(x-c)+f(x).
This is simplified as I want to keep it short for now, but I sure do enjoy involving math, and physics into computer programming. Well thats all for now.
